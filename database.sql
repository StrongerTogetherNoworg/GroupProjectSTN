'People who are sick should not be without food. 
Yet, every day, our neighbors with life-threatening illnesses find themselves unable to shop or cook — and, often, without the support network to help.
That is where we come in. Open Arms of Minnesota is a nonprofit organization that prepares and delivers nourishing meals free of charge to critically ill Minnesotans and their families. 
Our registered dietitians and in-house chefs create delicious, medically tailored menus using fresh and organic ingredients whenever possible. 
Through the support of a loving community of donors and volunteers, we harvest, cook, and deliver nutritious, made-from-scratch meals directly to our clients.
At Open Arms, we believe that food is medicine, and there is always room for one more at our table.',
